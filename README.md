## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Decisions

### Component Structure

The application follows a modular component architecture:

```
├── app/                  # Next.js App Router pages
│   ├── admin/            # Admin dashboard pages
│   ├── auth/             # Authentication pages
│   ├── documents/        # Document management pages
│   ├── profile/          # User profile pages
│   └── qa/               # Q&A interface
├── components/           # Reusable React components
│   ├── admin/            # Admin-specific components
│   ├── documents/        # Document-related components
│   ├── qa/               # Q&A interface components
│   └── ui/               # UI components (shadcn)
├── hooks/                # Custom React hooks
├── lib/                  # Utility functions
├── providers/            # Context providers
└── services/             # API service layer
```

### Design Patterns

- **Service Layer Pattern**: API calls are abstracted into service modules
- **Provider Pattern**: Context providers for global state management
- **Compound Components**: For complex UI elements
- **Custom Hooks**: For reusable logic

### Performance Optimizations

- Server components for improved initial load time
- Client components only where interactivity is needed
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Code splitting and lazy loading
